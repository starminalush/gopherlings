//
// Problem:
// Up to now we have seen functions receive a copy of their arguments
// and are unable to modify them directly. This is not the case for all types in Go.
//
// The slice type we saw just now actually holds a reference to the underlying
// memory contained in the slice. What this means is that a copy of a slice
// does not copy the memory in the indices of the slice. This can lead
// to unexpected behaviour if gophers are not careful.
//
// This reference behaviour may be clearer after learning about pointers.
